# Static folder
This folder contains the static design that will be used to create the react app. To run the static app use the following steps:

--> go to the 'static' folder. Make sure this folder has package.json among other folder.

--> execute 'npm install' to install dependencies.

--> execute 'npm start'. This will compile the code and launch the default browser to the url 'localhost:3000'. If for some reasons the browser does not open, then manually type the url 'localhost:3000' on the browser.
The static app designed and tested on Chrome and Firefox on desktop resolution.
